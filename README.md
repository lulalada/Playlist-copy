# Playlist-copy
this is basic music player on Swift. App can be run on simulator. No need for any other preparations before running.
First view consists of table view and small player. Cells are made with .xib file.
On click to one of the cells we go to second page that is main player, and song starts to play. We have play/pause, go back and go forward buttons.
When we go back, song continues to play and we can pause through mini player.
